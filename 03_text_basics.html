        I've heard good things about going here:

    <address>
        Margaritaville Island Reserve Riviera Cancun <br>
        SomewhereCity
    </address>
    <!-- A Block element will start a new line and have space around it.-->

    <!-- Since < is being interpreted as HTML, you can use HTML entities. -->
