                    <h4>Forms and Inputs</h4>
                    This one was actually quite interesting. It was quite fun to test the different inputs and see which
                    ones already seemed familiar to me from the user's perspective.

                    <h4>Semantic tags</h4>
                    Here I learned about semantic tags and more importantly what tags give semantic meaning and what
                    tags don't.

                    I learned about all the cool table features in HTML.

                    <h4>Adding images</h4>
                    In this one I learnt how to add images and all the attributes that come with it. I included some
                    picture of my two conures Atlas and Silas.

                    <h4>Adding links</h4>
                    In this one I learned how to add links. This is now being put to the test as I am writing this
                    index-website.

                    I learnt text basics. This meant that I could finally fill the page with some information.

                    I learnt quite a bit about the head element, but unfortunately the website itself looks exactly like
                    my
                    previous boring website.
